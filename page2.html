        experience for children and their adult caregivers.

        time.
        <br><br>Items used in Story Time:
      <ul class="a">
        <li>Books</li>
        <li>Musical Instruments</li>
        <li>Felt Boards</li>
        <li>Puppets</li>
        <li>Scarves</li>
        <li>Any number of other objects to heighten the literacy experience</li>

      <p> Mother Goose on the Loose is a popular early-literacy program for children from birth to age 3 with their
        parents or caregivers that enhances parent/child bonding, helps with the development of the Whole Child, and
        focuses on learning through play.Mother Goose on the Loose has been recognized as a "best early literacy
        practice" locally and nationally.
        <br>
        The MGOTL format is often used for baby story time due to its repetition of various activities such as rhymes,
        songs, puppets, a flannel board and felt pieces, books, and instruments.
