      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        I hope this website can provide resources and ideas for children's programming in public libraries. 
        Library programs like storytime, music and movement, and early literacy workshops introduce children to language, storytelling, and books, laying the foundation for lifelong reading and learning.
      </p>
      <p>Programs designed for children cultivate curiosity and a love for knowledge by making learning fun and engaging. They create positive associations with reading and learning from a young age.
        Group activities such as storytime or craft sessions allow children to interact with peers, enhancing their social and communication skills in a safe and nurturing environment.
      </p>
      <p>Children's library programs often encourage parents and caregivers to participate, fostering family bonding and helping adults learn ways to support their childâ€™s development at home.
        Libraries serve as community hubs where children and families can connect, fostering a sense of belonging and shared purpose within the community.
